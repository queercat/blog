# brief overview of json

json is a rather popular file format, used for an things as simple as configs to literal databases.

here is some json file:

<code>```code $ cat belongings.json ```</code>

<code>
```json
{ 
    "occupants": {
        "mouse lawyer": ["cheese", "small blanket", "malpractice insurance"],
        "person": ["anxiety", "anxiety", "anxiety"]
    }
}
```
</code>

we can see why it might be attractive to write in this regarding its simplicity in human legibility.
also how its name reflects rather accurately what it is: [javascript object notation](https://www.json.org/json-en.html).

now the javascript is not so relevant anymore but it's catchy.

parsing
i'm going to be annoyingly verbose for a second. there are a few different kinds of parsing even within the field of computer science. this is a parser that takes syntax of a [formal grammer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formal_grammar) and turns it into tokens to be built into some kind of data structure.

the result of a parser can vary but is typically a structure known as a [parse tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parse_tree) or an [abstract syntax tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_syntax_tree).

parsing is a frankly rather complex subject, i encourage you to read about it to understand why certain approaches are better than others. the history is also fascinating, parsing was **the** hot thing in the 80s and 90s. people took some wild approaches and did very cool things with the concept.

you can find an amazing overview [here.](https://jeffreykegler.github.io/personal/timeline_v3) written by a Jeffrey Kegler who invented the marpa parsing algorithm himself.

# things we need to know to actually write a json parser

the approach i will be describing is a [recursive descent parser](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recursive_descent_parser). if you wanted you could definitely utilize a [scanerless approach.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scannerless_parsing)

the first thing we need to understand is the specifications and formal grammer of the language. we do this by looking at the somewhat scary [rfc8259.](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8259)

and after skimming through we see the beautiful:

<code>
```
JSON Grammar

A JSON text is a sequence of tokens. The set of tokens includes six
structural characters, strings, numbers, and three literal names.

A JSON text is a serialized value. Note that certain previous
specifications of JSON constrained a JSON text to be an object or an
array. Implementations that generate only objects or arrays where a
JSON text is called for will be interoperable in the sense that all
implementations will accept these as conforming JSON texts.

    JSON-text = ws value ws

These are the six structural characters:

    begin-array     = ws %x5B ws  ; [ left square bracket

    begin-object    = ws %x7B ws  ; { left curly bracket

    end-array       = ws %x5D ws  ; ] right square bracket

    end-object      = ws %x7D ws  ; } right curly bracket

    name-separator  = ws %x3A ws  ; : colon

    value-separator = ws %x2C ws  ; , comma

```
</code>

now this was a bit of a doozy for me reading the first time.

all it really describes is the idea that JSON is made up of groupings of characters. the concept of a token within parsing is really just that,
**groupings** of characters as defined by the **formal grammar** of the language.

if we check out the valid values we see:

<code>
```

3.  Values

A JSON value MUST be an object, array, number, or string, or one of
the following three literal names:

      false
      null
      true

The literal names MUST be lowercase. No other literal names are
allowed.

      value = false / null / true / object / array / number / string

      false = %x66.61.6c.73.65   ; false

      null  = %x6e.75.6c.6c      ; null

      true  = %x74.72.75.65      ; true

```
</code>

from that we can see that the valid values for some json value are as given:

<code>
```

[false, null, true, object, array, number, string]

````
</code>

i'll just throw a few example mini jsons to give you an idea:

## examples
<code>
```json
0 # simplest json file. this is valid, just not very useful.

"text" # a simple string.

[0, 1, 2, 3] # hooray array!

{"key": 0} # an object containing a key and a value.
# note that a key must always be a string.

# now it's important to remember objects and arrays can hold all values so:
{
    "suitcase": {
        "luggage": ["briefcase", "hamborger", {
            "socks": {
                "quantity": 10,
                "color": "greer"
            }
        }]
    }
}
# this is entirely valid.
# the relationships in this json could be expressed as
# object -> array [string, string, object -> array]
````

</code>

if you want to get technical with it you should learn [EBNF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extended_Backus%E2%80%93Naur_form)
which is a way of writing out language grammars. it is pretty useful in removing ambiguity for what things can actually be.

## making this useful

parsing is typically done through a set of steps. you consume the input source through a process
known as lexing or tokenizing to create tokens, those tokens get parsed into some higher level structure
typically an AST or Parse Tree and then you do something cool with that.

for our purposes the AST is all we want in whatever language we're using.

we want to convert this:

<code>
```json
{
    "crayons": {
        "red": 0,
        "green": 1,
        "orange": 0
    }
}
```
</code>
into something which we can manipulate like:
<code>
```python
# python
obj = parse(above_json)

num_of_crayons = obj["crayons"]

```
</code>
and so we begin our little journey. ✨
