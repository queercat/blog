```sh
sudo pacman -S icu ttf-dejavu sqlitebrowser

# how to fix pacman if it breaks because of libicuuc

```sh
pacman: error while loading shared libraries: libicuuc.so.76: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
```

you just need to [follow these instructions](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Pacman#Using_pacman-static) which will lead you to running

```sh
curl -L -o pacman-static https://pkgbuild.com/~morganamilo/pacman-static/x86_64/bin/pacman-static
chmod +x pacman-static
sudo ./pacman-static -Syu pacman
```
