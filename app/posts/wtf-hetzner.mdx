blurb: what's this cloud-init thingy?
description: how my VPS got pwned
---

a few weeks after provisioning a VPS from Hetzner, which had a nightmarish verification process to even use their platform mind you, i started getting pings
from automated abuse detection.

i ignored this at first as "maybe my service was just doing some wonky networking", it was a mastadon instance so that didn't seem too far fetched to me.


<img src="/imgs/Abuse1.png"/>

i don't think mastadon port scans random IP ranges, so i shutdown my VPS from the cloud console ASAP and tried to figure out what went wrong.

<Aside mood="default">
 it was a personal instance with no data i cared about leaking / losing, but it could've been much worse.
</Aside>

the provisioning process for a Hetzner box is pretty straight forward, if you've used a cloud console it has what you'd expect.

you can select an OS, choose from some preconfigured software, and then you can add your SSH keys!

i personally prefer to add my SSH keys via the provided serial console that most cloud providers give you, it also sends you
a root password in the mail that you have to change.

there's also this box to **specifically add a cloud-init configuration**, i'm going to **leave this blank since i don't want a cloud-init configuration**.

that sums up our configuration, a basic Ubuntu machine, no ssh keys selected, and **no cloud-init config**.

and this is why i use(d) Hetzner, dirt cheap!

with that done we can SSH into the machine with the emailed admin credentials.

alright great, we're in the machine. we've changed the password, and now we want to secure our VPS so that only we can access it. (there are other things we should do, but this is the most important one in terms of urgency.)

we just need to only allow pub/priv key authentication for sshd. to do this we just need to edit the /etc/ssh/sshd_config. <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/20898384/disable-password-authentication-for-ssh">https://stackoverflow.com/questions/20898384/disable-password-authentication-for-ssh</a>

in that file we'll find this snippet.

```
# To disable tunneled clear text passwords, change to no here!
#PasswordAuthentication yes
```

alright cool, let's just uncomment that (back of mind: huh, weird that it's commented out, does it allow passwords by default? whatever.), and set it to no like it says.

```diff
# To disable tunneled clear text passwords, change to no here!
- #PasswordAuthentication yes
+ PasswordAuthentication no
```

and to enable our changes, just restart the ssh service.

```ssh
sudo systemctl restart ssh
```

now let's exit and ssh, we should be "locked out".

```sh
logout
Connection to 157.180.76.96 closed.
➜  moon ssh root@157.180.76.96
root@157.180.76.96's password:
```

huh, that's weird, i swear we just disabled password authentication, maybe it won't work if we submit our new password?

```
root@157.180.76.96's password: ****
Welcome to Ubuntu 24.04.3 LTS (GNU/Linux 6.8.0-71-generic x86_64)
```

wtf, what's going on here? let's look at that sshd config one more time.

```
root@hetzner-example:~# cat /etc/ssh/sshd_config

# this line is important
Include /etc/ssh/sshd_config.d/*.conf

# To disable tunneled clear text passwords, change to no here!
PasswordAuthentication no
#PermitEmptyPasswords no
```

huh, i wonder what that Include sshd_config.d thingy is doing? what's in there?

```sh
root@hetzner-example:~# ls /etc/ssh/sshd_config.d
50-cloud-init.conf
```

oh it's just a cloud-init confi-, wait i didn't use cloud-init did i? wtf is that?

```sh
root@hetzner-example:~# cat /etc/ssh/sshd_config.d/50-cloud-init.conf
PasswordAuthentication yes
```

WTF? is it a SINGLE file, whose sole purpose is to set PasswordAuthentication to yes, which appears to override me setting it to no? surely not.

to test i guess, lets delete it and reload sshd to see what happens. maybe i did something wrong?

```sh
root@hetzner-example:~# rm /etc/ssh/sshd_config.d/50-cloud-init.conf
root@hetzner-example:~#
root@hetzner-example:~# sudo systemctl restart ssh
root@hetzner-example:~# exit
logout
Connection to 157.180.76.96 closed.
```
great, now lets' try logging back in.
```sh
➜ moon ssh root@157.180.76.96
root@157.180.76.96: Permission denied (publickey).
```
oh, cool, so that's how  my server got pwned.

# tl;dr + key takeways
hetzner includes a weird cloud-init that enables SSH password authentication. hetzner does not tell you they do this, and even allow you to have an empty cloud-init configuration, which is the default.

sshd_configs apply the configuration "bottom up", the first thing set is the value it'll be evaluated to at runtime, meaning that us disabling the password authentication gets overriden by the Include.
whatever password i set was obtained and thus my machine pwned.

<Aside mood="rat">
when i did this for my mastodon server, the first thing i did was add my ssh keys to the machine. when i was able to login after disabling ssh i wasn't surprised, now i'll be checking on every machine i provision in the future.
</Aside>

## lessons learned:

provide your ssh pubkeys up front to your cloud provider so they don't apply weirdo configs and send your password over email.

absolutely make sure all account passwords are secure and securely stored.

disable ssh root access entirely, leave it to the serial console if you can help it.

sandbox things into users.

something something fail2ban.

make sure you **actually** disable password authentication for SSHD.

# remaining questions?
why does Hetzner do it this way? is this an Ubuntu thing? this behavior doesn't happen notably if you provide your SSH keys up front (my new preference after this fiasco). 

# suggested fix?
add some kind of warning or comment via 
<code>
```sh
sed -i -E 's/#?PasswordAuthentication yes/# disable this in the cloud-init thingy/ /etc/ssh/sshd_config'
```
</code>
into the sshd_config to let others know they can't just disable it where they expect.
